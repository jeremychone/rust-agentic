**EXPERIMENTAL**: This is an experimental library at this point, but the goal is to become a support library for implementing MCP and Agent-to-Agent Services and Clients.

The current objectives are:

- `agentic::mcp` provides types to support the MCP Client and Server Protocols.

- `agentic::a2a` (coming later) provides types to support the A2A Client and Server Protocols.
