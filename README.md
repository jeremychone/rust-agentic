**NOTE**: At present, only the initial types are available to give an idea of the direction. While these may not be particularly useful, development is expected to progress rapidly.

Agentic will utilize the [genai](https://crates.io/crates/genai) library to connect with various Generative AI Providers, including OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, and others.
